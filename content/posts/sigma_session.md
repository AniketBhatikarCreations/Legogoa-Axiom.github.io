We all gathered at Venkatesh's house for the session. The team arrived at 5:00 all of us welcomed them. We explained our robot to them and told them our strategy for the manual control period. 
 Then the building session started. We had a lot of doubts about the building, and our robot had many errors. Team to know each other Sigma helped us to solve these issues. They also taught us how to set up the game elements.

 Then comes the team bonding session. In the team bonding session, we came to know each other better and played a few games. We all enjoyed it! After that, we focused on the build and solved the remaining problems of the robot.
